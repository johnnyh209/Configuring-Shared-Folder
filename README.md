# Configuring-Shared-Folder

The goal of this project is to share a folder from Windows Server 2019, and map that shared drive on the Windows 10 Enterprise systems. All of this is done using VirtualBox.

# Adding a New Disk Drive

I started off by adding a new drive to the Windows Server 2019 VM so as to isolate the shared folders from the main C: drive. To add a new drive, I right-clicked on the Windows Server 2019 VM and clicked on `Settings`. Within the `Settings` window, I clicked on `Storage`. This window will show you a list of the storage drives active in the VM. From here, there are two buttons that you can click: (1) the button with an image of a hard disk and a green plus sign at the top, or (2) the button with a floppy disc icon and green plus sign at the bottom, and then choosing `Hard Disk`. I highlighted these buttons in red squares; Refer to the image below:
